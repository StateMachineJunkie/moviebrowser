/// like to make this an `actor` class but for now I'm delaying as I've heard
/// rumors of bugs in the release builds of Apple concurrency model for `async/await`.
/// I also have no idea what kind of performance overhead this might produce.
/// For now, the best practice is to always invoke the methods for this class
/// from the same thread context (usually main). If this practice is not followed,
/// you will have concurrency issues and undefined behavior.
